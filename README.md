Hey there! I'm Yazeed ðŸ‘‹

Industrial Engineer by training, Machine Learning enthusiast by passion. I love digging into data, building models, and finding ways to make processes smarter and more efficient.

A Little About Me:
â€¢My background in Industrial Engineering taught me how to make data-driven decisionsâ€”now Iâ€™m hooked on using ML to solve real problems.
â€¢Whether itâ€™s supervised or unsupervised learning, I enjoy experimenting with algorithms to see what insights I can uncover.
â€¢When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in datasets, Iâ€™m probably tinkering with simulations or optimizing systems.

What I Work With
Code & Tools: Python â€¢ MATLAB â€¢ MySQL â€¢ Simio
Data & ML: Cleaning messy data â€¢ Analysis â€¢ Predictive modeling
Engineering Software: Minitab â€¢ LINGO

What Iâ€™m Up To
â€¢Exploring deeper into MLâ€”especially how to fine-tune models for better accuracy.
â€¢Cleaning and prepping data (because letâ€™s be honest, thatâ€™s half the battle).
